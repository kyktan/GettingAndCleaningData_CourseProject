GettingAndCleaningData_CourseProject
====================================

Course project submissions for Coursera MOOC - Getting and Cleaning Data

The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The files in this repo (other than this README.md) are: 
1) an R script called run_analysis.R that can be run to perform the analysis
2) a code book called CodeBook.md that describes the variables, the data, and transformations and work  performed to clean up the data. 

**run_analysis.R**

A single R script run_analysis.R contains the code to:

1) Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
